# Lume-Deployment

Lume-Deployment - soon to be renamed, is a package that allows you do deploy any model with an arbitrary number of inputs and outputs, related data transformations and system interfaces. 

Each deployment is defined by a model, typically hosted and retrieved from [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) and YAML file that describes the DG (Directed Graph) of model, transformations and interfaces. There are no restrictions on the numbers and types of nodes in the graph, so it may be used for things other than ML models.
